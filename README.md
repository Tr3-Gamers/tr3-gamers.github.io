# Tr3 Gamers

Tr3 Gamers is a gaming club for the students of Tampere University and Tampere
University of Applied Sciences! We organize events and gaming sessions for
a variety of games and help stream other clubs' events to the masses.

## Smash Bros 

T3G has a long history in Smash! We have been organizing large scale tournaments like
Bob-Omb Battlefield and [Smash Sauna](https://twitter.com/SmashSauna). We also
have monthlies at our clubroom!

The **monthlies are typically held on the first Tuesday of the month 17.00-22.00**, see #tampere
in [Smash Finland's Discord](https://smashfinland.fi/) for registration each month.

## Dancing games

Ever seen those videos of people dancing on a pad and hitting sliding arrows?
We do that here! We primarily play with ITGMania. The clubroom has two modded
pads, a big 120 fps screen, and a massive fan for cooling. Bring your water
bottle and sweatpants, this e-sport is very physical!

We have **weeklies every Wednesday 18.00-22.00**. If you're a student at Tampere
University, you can just walk in during that time, the clubroom's doors are
open. Otherwise, ask on the #tanssipelit channel on our Discord!

Beginners welcome! Our friendly community regularly helps new players get
started. It's completely free even if you aren't a member, so you can just try
it out once or twice to see if dance games are for you!

## Events

We organize various gaming-related events, like RWPT (Random WideoPeliTurnaus)
during Wappu, LAN events and tournaments.

## Streaming

We have a large amount of streaming gear at our clubroom, as well as the
know-how for organizing livestreams for students events! Contact us at
tr3gamersry (at) gmail.com if you're interested in this kind of services.

# Find us on campus!

Our clubroom resides in the bomb shelter of Tampere University's Hervanta campus.
It's a black door with our logo on it, next to a bunch of gray lockers, in the
end of a large empty hall (the area where sitsi's are held).

If in doubt, wait at the [ramp outside](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bWa6XuF3Z9Hs6DSx8)
and ping @hallitus on Discord to come open the door for you.
